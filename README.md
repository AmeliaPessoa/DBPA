# DBPA
Android Database Performance Analysis

This app makes some operations in mobile databases comparing performance at some NoSQL and the SQLite database.

This analysis considers the following databases:
1. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
2. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/database/)
3. [Couchbase Lite](https://www.couchbase.com/products/mobile)
4. [iBoxDB](http://www.iboxdb.com/)
5. [SnappyDB](https://github.com/nhachicha/SnappyDB)
6. [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-java)

The operations are done by the `Analysis` class except by the Firebase class because it is event oriented and the `Analysis` class expects returns.

The number of iterations can be changed in the constant `ITERATIONS` in the class `Analysis` and will be reflected in all code.

The model used is very simple with only two classes: `Author` and `Post`. The relationship entity diagram can be seen in the image bellow:

Some adaptations must to be done in the model class for each database. For example, the iBox database doesn't allow embedded documents and for this reason, we have additional attributes to save only the keys for the embedded objects. For the same database, all attributes must be public.
For the Realm database, some annotations must be put in models class.

The analysis begins in the `MainActivity` class. It instantiates each class that represents each database.

For all databases, no one configuration tuning or indexes are created.

## Firebase Analysis
To run Firebase analysis is necessary to insert a personal key on the project. The instructions to make it is at this [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

## How to contribute
An analysis in a new database can add with the following steps:
1. Insert new dependencies in the `gradle.config` file;
2. Create a new class inheriting from the `Analysis` class and implement the abstract methods;
3. Include in `MainActivity` class a call for the new class;
4. Modify the instructions in this `README` document if it is necessary.

Also to improve the current code, pull requests are welcomed.
